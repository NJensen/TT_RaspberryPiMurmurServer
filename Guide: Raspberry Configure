Raspi-config
You need to do some configuring of the raspberry pi before installing Murmur on it.
The is a Step-by-Step guide
1.  Configure Keyboard layout so it fit your keyboard
  a.	Wheezy Raspbain have a lot of preconfigured keyboard and layout
  b.	Choose your keyboard and layout.
  c.	At the end it will ask for X Server say no
2.	Change Password
  a.	Optional to change password, bur form a security point of view it is a good idea.
    i.	If you choose to change enter your new password twice.
3.	Set Timezone
  a.	Select Europa and then Copenhagen
4.	SSH enable
  a.	Make sure that when you have selected SSH that you enable SSH Server
5.	Last run an update

If you forget or want to change in it later, you can do it by writing this command: sudo raspi-config

6.	Now you have to set a static IP address on your Raspberry Pi.
  a.	It can be done by setting static IP from your Raspberry Pi if you write:
              Sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
1.	Change: iface eth0 inet dhcp to iface eth0 inet static
2.	And add following under:
              address 192.168.y.xxx
              netmask 255.255.255.0
              network 192.168.y.0
              broadcast 192.168.1.255
              gateway 192.168.y.1
  b.  Another way you can do it from you Router by reserving an Ip address to your Raspberry Pi’s Mac.
    i.	I have a TP-Link 1043ND for reserving an Ip address you do:
1.	Login to your Router – Standard TP Link Software
2.	Choose DHCP from menu to the left
3.	Choose from submenu: Address Reservation
4.	Click: Add New…
5.	And enter Mac address and the following Ip address
